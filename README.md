#### 7) Create a README file to answer the following question-

#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

ANSWER : var → old, function-scoped, can redeclare & update

let → block-scoped, can update, cannot redeclare

const → block-scoped, cannot update or redeclare

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

ANSWER : map() → makes a new array with results of a function

forEach() → just loops over array, returns nothing

filter() → makes a new array with only elements that pass a test

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

ANSWER : Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in ES6.

Syntax: (params) => { code }

They don’t have their own this, which makes them handy inside objects or callbacks.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

ANSWER : Destructuring assignment in ES6 allows to take values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a single line. For example, you can extract elements from an array using square brackets like const [a, b] = [1, 2], or get properties from an object using curly braces like const {x, y} = {x: 5, y: 10}. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

ANSWER : Template literals in ES6 allow you to create strings using backticks ` instead of quotes. You can easily insert variables or expressions inside a string using ${variable}. Unlike normal string concatenation, template literals are cleaner, easier to read, and support multi-line strings without using \n.
